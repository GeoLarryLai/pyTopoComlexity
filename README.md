# TopoComlexity

This repository includes a set of codes that perform various types of geomorphic metrics representing topographic complexity and/or variability. The repository is currently under development. The geomorphic metrics planned to be included here are:  
* _Mexican Hat Wavelet Tranform Analysis_ (pyMexicanHat.ipynb)
* _Terrain Ruggedness Index_ (TBA)
* _Rugosity_ (TBA)
* _Roughness_ (TBA)
* _Fractal dimension_ (TBA)

Recommended reference for these topographic metrics:

In November, 2023, this MATLAB code was optimized by Dr. Larry Syu-Heng Lai (Univeristy of Washington). It is further translated into a python version. Citations:
